# Light Novel Web Crawler

Web crawler project that will for now go through esj zone's website and obtain newest novel updates

Currently will save and update database with the latest novel updates on front page.

Database should save a table of novels, and every time scraper is called, the table will be updated.

needs to have good front end integration and second table to keep track of user's bookmarked novels

Eventually this should also scrape websites such as shimo.moe for updated novels, but this integration will be held off for now.

### Front-end features

- novel display with selector for favourites

- updated daily 

- needs to keep track the last read chapter for each novel: needs implementation in the backend as well
